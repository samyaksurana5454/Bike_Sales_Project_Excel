# Bike_Sales_Project_Excel

# I created an effective bike sales project dashboard in Excel by following these steps:

Identified key metrics: I determined the important metrics to track, such as total sales, average sales per region, and sales by marital status and education level.

Built pivot tables: I created pivot tables based on the identified metrics, utilizing marital status, region, and education as filters or row/column fields.

Added interactive elements: I incorporated dropdown menus and slicers, allowing users to select marital status, region, or education level to dynamically update the data and charts.

Designed charts and graphs: I utilized various chart types to visually represent sales data, highlighting trends and making comparisons between regions or education levels.

Included summary tables: I added summary tables that displayed key metrics, providing a comprehensive overview of sales data based on selected filters.

Formatted and customized: I applied formatting techniques to enhance the visual appeal and user-friendliness of the dashboard, using colors, fonts, and borders.

Tested and refined: I thoroughly tested the functionality of the dashboard, ensuring that changing filter values accurately updated the data and charts. I made necessary refinements to improve the user experience.

I saved the dashboard as a separate sheet in the Excel file, making it easy to update and share.
